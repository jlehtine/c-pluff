C-Pluff (0.1.2) alpha

  * [X] Removed a flawed check of whether dynamically resolved symbols are
        in use when a plug-in is being stopped.
  * [X] Fixed a bug in libcpluff: When stopping plug-in dependency chains,
        first call stop function of every plug-in in the chain and then call
        destroy functions. This makes it possible to do safe two-phase cleanup.
        Previously the destroy function of a plug-in was called immediately
        after the stop function of the corresponding plug-in.
  * [X] Make plug-in dependency loop log message an informational message
        and not a warning.
  * [X] Minor documentation changes and corrections.
  * [X] Build, install and distribute internationalization support files.
  * [X] Link with libintl if internationalization support needs it.
  * [X] Unified message string structure and wording.
  * [X] Include finnish translation (to test internationalization).
  * [X] Fixed some installation/packaging problems.
  * [X] Install documentation as part of installation.
  * [X] Install example source code as part of installation.
  * [X] Include optional stand-alone build system for example code.
  * [X] Respect DESTDIR during installation.
