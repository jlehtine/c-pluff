BUILDING C-PLUFF
================

These are minimal instructions for building the C-Pluff framework
implementation.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

To build C-Pluff, you need to have following prerequisites installed:

  - a C library supporting POSIX dlopen
    (for example, GNU C library)
    or
    GNU Libtool libltdl library and associated header files
    (http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/)

  - Expat XML Parser library and associated header files
    (http://expat.sourceforge.net/)


BUILDING
--------

To build C-Pluff, follow the usual autotools procedure:

  Building in source directory:
    ./configure
    make

  Building in separate build directory:
    cd BUILD_DIR
    SRC_DIR/configure
    make

For help on available configuration options:

  ./configure --help


INSTALL
-------

To install the library and header files:

  make install
