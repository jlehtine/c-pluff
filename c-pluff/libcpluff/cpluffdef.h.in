/**
 * @defgroup symbolVisibility Symbol visibility
 * @ingroup cDefines cxxDefines
 *
 * Macros for controlling inter-module symbol visibility and linkage. These
 * macros have platform specific values. #CP_EXPORT, #CP_IMPORT and #CP_HIDDEN
 * can be reused by plug-in implementations for better portability. The
 * complexity is mostly due to Windows DLL exports and imports.
 *
 * @anchor symbolVisibilityExample
 * Each module should usually define its own macro to declare API symbols with
 * #CP_EXPORT and #CP_IMPORT as necessary. For example, a mobule could define
 * a macro @c MY_API in the API header file as follows.
 *
 * @code
 * #ifndef MY_API
 * #  define MY_API CP_IMPORT
 * #endif
 * @endcode
 *
 * By default the API symbols would then be marked for import which is correct
 * when client modules are including the API header file. When compiling the
 * module itself the option @c -DMY_API=CP_EXPORT would be passed to the compiler to
 * override the API header file and to mark the API symbols for export.
 * The overriding definition could also be included in module source files or
 * in an internal header file before including the API header file.

/**
 * @def CP_EXPORT
 *
 * Declares a symbol to be exported for inter-module usage. When compiling the
 * module which defines the symbol this macro should be placed
 * at the start of the symbol declaration to ensure that the symbol is exported
 * to other modules. However, when compiling other modules the declaration of
 * the symbol should start with #CP_IMPORT.
 * See @ref symbolVisibilityExample "the example" of how to do this.
 */

/**
 * @def CP_IMPORT
 *
 * Declares a symbol to be imported from another module. When compiling a
 * module which uses the symbol this macro should be placed at the start of
 * the symbol declaration to ensure that the symbol is imported from the
 * defining module. However, when compiling the defining module the declaration
 * of the symbol should start with #CP_EXPORT.
 * See @ref symbolVisibilityExample "the example" of how to do this.
 */

/**
 * @def CP_HIDDEN
 *
 * Declares a symbol hidden from other modules. This macro should be
 * placed at the start of the symbol declaration to hide the symbol from other
 * modules (if supported by the platform). This macro is not intended to be
 * used with symbols declared as "static" which are already internal to the
 * object file. Some platforms do not support hiding of symbols and therefore
 * unique prefixes should be used for global symbols internal to the module
 * even when they are declared using this macro.
